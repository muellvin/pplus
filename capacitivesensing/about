general idea:
RC circuit, where the the capacitor is created as such,
that the electric field lines extend into open space.
The presence of a conductive object or apparently material with
a high dielectric constant changes the capacitance of the setup.

the change in capacitance can be monitored through change in the current-
voltage ratio:
C = I / (dV/dt)

when an AC source is used with for example a step function,
one should be able to determine the capacitance through time integration
C = integration(I) / (V-V0)
